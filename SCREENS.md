Description of the screens and their differences:

### Mobile

* Logo (MyHoliday travels) disappears from this screen and is replaced by Bootstrap Hamburger menu
* The Icons are smaller for Search (search bar is minimised and when clicked the icon reveals the search bar across the navbar), the account menu and shoppingcart/bag are replaced with just the Icons and smaller titles - you can also still see the total amount of packages (Â£) in your bag.
* When you click the dropdown menu you see the search sorting (i.e. by categories and view all packages by price, name, rating etc)
* When scrolled down, scroll to top button appears in bottom right hand corner
* On the all packages page, the cards for the individual packages align vertically on the page, description fitting width of page on the mobile device
* All forms fit across the width of the screen  
* The footer and navbar menu are minimised to fit the width of the page, with the footer contents vertically aligned and the navbar menu elements stacked in an accessible way, when opening the navbar menu the minimised menu options are shown and push down the rest of the content smoothly without negative disruption to the UX or design of the page
* Home page video is minimised and you see clearly a snippet of the video in the background
* The checkout app page fits the width of the page, all forms and tables aligned to fit the screen size
* When packages are added to the cart, the notification toast appears at the top (under menu) and pushes the rest of the page down smoothly
* Allauth pages, e.g. login/sign up/ sign out fit the width of the page.

### Desktop/Tablet

* The main logo appears on all pages at the top center-left with the navbar neatly laid out across the width of the page but justified centrally on the page
* All forms fit the width of the page. Some forms are aligned to col-6 in Bootstrap styling to provide variety and in cases where the page is split for view, e.g. profile page
* For the sign in and allauth fit half the page and options are aligned left of the page to draw the attention of the user and to avoid accidental clicking/user error (i.e. if they accidentally logged out, these are slightly left aligned to ensure user fully reads content)
* When scrolled down, the scroll to top button appears in bottom right hand corner
* Toasts appear on top of all elements when notifications are given.
* On the single package pages, the elements fit the width of the page with the description sitting across the page and the picture and small details about the package are justified center and in two columns.
